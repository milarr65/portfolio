					<p>
						Up until a year ago I was studying graphic design, but at one point
						I realized that even though I like the arts I'd rather leave that as
						a hobby. At one point in college I took a class called "Web Page
						Design" and ever since then I haven't stopped learning about web
						development and programming in general.
						<br />
						<br />
						And well here i am, building up some prejects little by little. This
						is the career I actually want to persue.
