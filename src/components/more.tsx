						Hi! I'm Mila, a 25-year-old self-taught web developer based in
						Mexico City. I‚Äôm bilingual (Spanish is my first language, and I‚Äôve
						studied English since childhood). I also enjoy learning other
						languages, I can even read and write a little Korean.
						<br />
						<br />I originally studied graphic design and earned an associate‚Äôs
						degree in high school, with plans to pursue that career. But during
						college, I took a <em>Web Design</em> class where I discovered how
						much I enjoyed working with HTML and CSS. That experience completely
						shifted my path: I realized I was more passionate about building
						websites than designing them.
						<br />
						<br />
						Since then, I‚Äôve been focused on learning full-stack web
						development. I‚Äôve completed online courses like{" "}
						<em>The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp</em> and{" "}
						<em>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</em> by Dr.
						Angela Yu, and I continue to build projects to strengthen my skills.
						<br />
						<br />
						Now, I‚Äôm working toward a career in web development, combining my
						design background with my passion for coding to create websites that
						are both functional and visually engaging.
